# Image Processing with MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code for reading a color image, converting it to grayscale, and performing histogram equalization.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open MATLAB.
3. Run the provided script `image_processing.m`.

## Code Explanation
- `read.png`: Input color image.
- `image_processing.m`: MATLAB script for image processing.
- `Histogram`: Shows the original and equalized image along with their histograms.

## Results
![Original Image](/MATLAB%20Drive/read.png)

![Histogram Equalised Image](/MATLAB%20Drive/eqImg.png)
*Figure 2: Histogram Equalised Image*

## Notes
- Ensure MATLAB Drive is accessible.
- Turn off warnings for cleaner output.
